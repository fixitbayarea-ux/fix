### Session 14 (Mar 26 2026) — Contact Page Refinements + About Page Images Fix

- Added Google Maps iframe (Bay Area — San Francisco, Marin, Peninsula) to Service Area panel
- Verified: 0 remaining references to old email across entire codebase
- **BUG FIX**: Migrated 2 Andrei team photos from external CDN to local `/images/team/` as WebP (34KB + 23KB). Added explicit width/height for CLS prevention. External CDN was unreliable on production Netlify deploys.
- **SEO**: Enhanced structured data on /about — Person schema (Andrei Suprunov, hasCredential, knowsAbout) + global LocalBusiness enriched with foundingDate, numberOfEmployees, employee. Removed duplicate LocalBusiness from AboutPage (global SchemaMarkup.js is single source of truth via MutationObserver dedup).
- **SEO**: Added AggregateRating to /reviews page LocalBusiness schema (ratingValue 4.9, reviewCount 90, bestRating 5, worstRating 1). Whitelisted `reviews-localbusiness` in SchemaMarkup.js MutationObserver dedup. Updated global reviewCount to 90.
- **SEO**: Set `noindex, follow` on `/privacy-policy` and `/site-map` pages to save crawl budget.
- **Legal**: Created `/terms` page (Terms of Service) with 8 sections: Services Provided, Appointments & Scheduling, Diagnostic Fee, Payment Terms, 180-Day Warranty, Limitation of Liability, Governing Law (CA), Contact & Disputes. `noindex, follow`. Linked from UnifiedFooter and Privacy Policy.
- **UI**: Fixed /blog card grid — enforced 1-col mobile (≤600px), 2-col tablet (601-900px), 3-col desktop via `index.css`. Fixed blog H3 from 15px → 17px minimum.
- **E-E-A-T**: Added `BlogByline` component to all 14 blog posts — "By Andrei · Lead Technician, FixitBay" + `<time datetime="...">` + readTime. Updated BlogPosting schema author name to "Andrei Suprunov" across all posts.
- **Internal Linking**: Added 2-4 contextual service page links per blog post (refrigerator-repair, washer-repair, dryer-repair, dishwasher-repair, oven-repair, ice-maker-repair). Created `BlogCTA.js` component ("Get Expert Help — $60 Diagnostic — Book Online") and inserted into all 14 blog posts before Related Articles section.
- **UI**: Fixed /services page mobile grid overflow — changed from 3-col (568px+) to 2-col on ≤600px. Cards use vertical icon layout on mobile for readability. No page overflow at 390px.
- **BUG FIX**: Fixed duplicate "Home → Home" breadcrumb on /maintenance. Root cause: `breadcrumbCategoryName="Home"` in MaintenanceHub.js. Fixed to `"Maintenance"` with self-referencing detection in template. Also fixed "Maintenance Maintenance" duplication in H1/eyebrow by detecting when appliance name already contains serviceWord.
- **PROMPT 01-07**: Mobile Hero CALL button differentiation, Hero Trust Strip visual box, Global brand rename "FixitBay" → "FixitBay LLC", Mobile Hero Stats 3-col grid with dividers, How It Works connector arrows, Homepage Blog section revamp with visual cards.
- **PROMPT 08**: Mobile footer accordion optimization in `UnifiedFooter.js` — sections collapsed by default (max-height:0), smooth CSS transition, ChevronDown rotation, 0px gap between sections on mobile, border-top separators, reduced padding. Desktop 4-col grid preserved unchanged. Testing: 9/9 tests passed (iteration_106).

## Backlog (Prioritized)
- P2: Continue migrating inline styles to Tailwind/CSS vars (ApplianceRepairPageNew.js, MobileServiceLanding.js)
- P3: Performance audit — code-split heavy sections, lazy-load below-fold content
